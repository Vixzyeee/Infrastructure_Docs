# Environment Variables

## Purpose
Explain how environment variables influence system behavior.

## Core Concept
Environment variables store key-value pairs
that affect program execution.

Common variables include:
- PATH
- HOME
- USER

Variables can be set temporarily
or persistently via shell configuration files.

## Engineer Notes
Most “command not found” issues
are PATH problems.

Understanding environment variables
is essential for scripting and automation.

## Summary
- Store execution context
- Affect program behavior
- Critical for scripting
