# Bash Control Flow

## Purpose
Control execution logic in Bash scripts.

## Core Concept
Bash supports basic control structures:
- if / else
- for loops
- while loops
- case statements

These structures enable conditional
and repeated execution.

## Engineer Notes
Shell scripts are for orchestration,
not heavy computation.

If control flow becomes complex,
consider Python instead.

## Summary
- Supports conditionals and loops
- Enables automation logic
- Keep scripts simple
