# Aliases and Functions

## Purpose
Customize and simplify shell usage.

## Core Concept
Aliases create shortcuts for commands.
Shell functions allow reusable logic.

Aliases are simple text replacements.
Functions provide more flexibility.

## Engineer Notes
Aliases improve productivity for humans.
Scripts should avoid aliases to prevent surprises.

Use functions when logic is involved.

## Summary
- Aliases shorten commands
- Functions add logic
- Use carefully in scripts
