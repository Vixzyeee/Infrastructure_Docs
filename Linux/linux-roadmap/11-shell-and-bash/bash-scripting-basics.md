# Bash Scripting Basics

## Purpose
Introduce basic Bash scripting concepts.

## Core Concept
A Bash script is a text file
containing shell commands.

Scripts usually start with a shebang:
`#!/bin/bash`

Scripts must be executable to run directly.

## Engineer Notes
Scripts automate repetition.
Bad scripts automate mistakes faster.

Write simple, readable scripts.
Complex logic belongs elsewhere.

## Summary
- Scripts automate commands
- Shebang defines interpreter
- Executable permission required
