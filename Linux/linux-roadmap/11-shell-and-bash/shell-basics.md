# Shell Basics

## Purpose
Explain what the shell is and what role it plays in Linux.

## Core Concept
The shell is a command interpreter.
It reads user input, expands variables and patterns,
and executes programs.

Bash is the most common default shell on Linux systems,
but others exist such as zsh and fish.

The shell is not the kernel.
It is a user-space program.

## Engineer Notes
Most automation failures come from misunderstanding
what the shell expands versus what programs receive.

If you don’t know where the shell stops,
debugging becomes guesswork.

## Summary
- Shell interprets commands
- Bash is the most common shell
- Shell is user-space, not the kernel
