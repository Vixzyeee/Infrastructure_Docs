# tree

## Purpose
Display directory structure in a tree format.

## Core Concept
The `tree` command visualizes directories recursively,
making it easier to understand structure at a glance.

It may need to be installed separately.

## Engineer Notes
`tree` is excellent for documentation and audits,
but avoid running it on very large directories.

## Summary
- Shows directory hierarchy
- Useful for visual inspection
