# cd

## Purpose
Change the current working directory.

## Core Concept
The `cd` command moves you between directories.

Examples:
- `cd /etc`
- `cd ..`
- `cd ~`

Paths can be absolute or relative.

## Engineer Notes
Most mistakes come from misunderstanding relative paths.
Use absolute paths when scripting to avoid ambiguity.

## Summary
- Changes directories
- Supports absolute and relative paths
