# Fail2Ban

## Purpose
Protect services from brute-force attacks.

## Core Concept
Fail2Ban monitors logs
and blocks IP addresses
that show malicious behavior.

It works by adding temporary firewall rules.

## Engineer Notes
Fail2Ban reduces noise,
but it is not a replacement
for proper authentication.

Use it as a safety net,
not your only defense.

## Summary
- Blocks brute-force attempts
- Log-based detection
- Supplemental protection
