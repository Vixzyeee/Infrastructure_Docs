# SSH Basics

## Purpose
Explain secure remote access using SSH.

## Core Concept
SSH provides encrypted remote access
to Linux systems.

It supports:
- password authentication
- key-based authentication
- port forwarding

SSH is a primary attack target.

## Engineer Notes
If SSH is exposed,
it must be hardened.

Never assume “nobody will find it”.

## Summary
- Encrypted remote access
- Common attack surface
- Must be secured
