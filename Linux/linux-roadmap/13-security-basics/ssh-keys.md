# SSH Key Authentication

## Purpose
Explain key-based SSH authentication.

## Core Concept
SSH keys use asymmetric cryptography.
A private key stays on the client.
A public key is stored on the server.

Key-based authentication
is more secure than passwords.

## Engineer Notes
Disable password authentication
once key-based access is verified.

Protect private keys.
If leaked, access is compromised.

## Summary
- Uses public/private keys
- More secure than passwords
- Private keys must be protected
