# Linux Security Basics

## Purpose
Introduce fundamental Linux security principles.

## Core Concept
Linux security is based on:
- least privilege
- isolation
- auditing
- defense in depth

Security is not a single tool.
It is a collection of controls
working together.

## Engineer Notes
Most breaches succeed because of misconfiguration,
not zero-day exploits.

Simple, boring security
beats clever but fragile setups.

## Summary
- Security is layered
- Least privilege matters
- Misconfiguration is the biggest risk
