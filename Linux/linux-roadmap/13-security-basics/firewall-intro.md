# Firewall Introduction

## Purpose
Explain what a firewall does in Linux.

## Core Concept
A firewall controls network traffic
by allowing or blocking connections
based on rules.

Linux firewalls operate at the kernel level
using netfilter.

Firewalls do not replace secure services.
They reduce exposure.

## Engineer Notes
If a service does not need to be exposed,
do not expose it.

A firewall is not optional
on internet-facing systems.

## Summary
- Controls network traffic
- Reduces attack surface
- Kernel-level enforcement
