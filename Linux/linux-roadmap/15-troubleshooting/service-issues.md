# Service Issues

## Purpose
Diagnose failing or misbehaving services.

## Core Concept
Service failures can result from:
- configuration errors
- missing dependencies
- permission problems
- resource exhaustion

Service logs explain failures.

## Engineer Notes
Restarting a service is not troubleshooting.
It is a temporary workaround.

Understand why it failed.

## Summary
- Services fail for specific reasons
- Logs explain failures
- Fix causes, not symptoms
