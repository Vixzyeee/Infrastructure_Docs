# Disk Issues

## Purpose
Diagnose common storage-related problems.

## Core Concept
Disk issues include:
- full filesystems
- missing mounts
- permission errors
- slow I/O

Disk problems often cascade
into service failures.

## Engineer Notes
Check disk space early.
A full disk breaks more things
than almost any other issue.

## Summary
- Disk issues affect system stability
- Full disks cause widespread failures
- Storage checks should be early
