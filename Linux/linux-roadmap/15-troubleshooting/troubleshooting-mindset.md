# Troubleshooting Mindset

## Purpose
Explain how to approach system problems logically.

## Core Concept
Troubleshooting is a process, not a command.
It involves observation, hypothesis, testing,
and verification.

Guessing wastes time.
Random fixes create new problems.

## Engineer Notes
Stay systematic.
Change one thing at a time.

If you don’t know what changed,
you don’t know what fixed it.

## Summary
- Troubleshooting is a process
- Avoid guessing
- Change one variable at a time
