# Reading Logs

## Purpose
Explain how to extract useful information from logs.

## Core Concept
Logs record errors, warnings, and events.
They provide context and timelines.

Important log locations:
- system journal
- /var/log
- application-specific logs

## Engineer Notes
Look for errors first.
Then look for patterns.

Logs usually explain failures
if you read them carefully.

## Summary
- Logs provide context
- Errors and warnings matter
- Patterns reveal causes
