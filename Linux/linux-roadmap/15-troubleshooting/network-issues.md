# Network Issues

## Purpose
Diagnose common networking problems.

## Core Concept
Network issues often involve:
- interface down
- wrong IP configuration
- routing problems
- DNS failures

Network debugging should follow layers.

## Engineer Notes
Always test with IP addresses first.
Separate DNS from connectivity issues.

Network problems are rarely random.

## Summary
- Network issues follow layers
- Test connectivity step by step
- DNS is often the culprit
