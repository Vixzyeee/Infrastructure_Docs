# Package Repositories

## Purpose
Explain where packages come from.

## Core Concept
Repositories are servers that host software packages.
Package managers download packages from configured repositories.

Repository configuration determines:
- available software
- package versions
- security updates

## Engineer Notes
Adding random repositories is a common mistake.
Every new repository increases attack surface and instability.

Trust repositories. Don’t collect them.

## Summary
- Repositories provide packages
- Configuration affects system stability
- Fewer repositories is usually better
