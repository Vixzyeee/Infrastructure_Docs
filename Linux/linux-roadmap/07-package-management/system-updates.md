# System Updates and Upgrades

## Purpose
Explain how system updates work and why they matter.

## Core Concept
Updates fix bugs and security issues.
Upgrades may change package versions or system behavior.

Not all updates are equal.
Security updates are critical.
Major upgrades require planning.

## Engineer Notes
Blind updates on production systems are irresponsible.
Test first. Always.

Update frequency should match system criticality.

## Summary
- Updates improve security and stability
- Upgrades can change system behavior
- Plan before updating critical systems
