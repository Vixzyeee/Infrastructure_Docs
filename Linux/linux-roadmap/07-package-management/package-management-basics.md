# Package Management Basics

## Purpose
Explain how Linux installs, removes, and manages software.

## Core Concept
Linux software is distributed as packages.
A package contains binaries, configuration files,
and metadata about dependencies.

A package manager handles installation,
dependency resolution, upgrades, and removal.

Different distributions use different package managers,
but the core concepts remain the same.

## Engineer Notes
Manual compilation is rare in modern systems.
Package managers exist to keep systems consistent and maintainable.

If you fight the package manager, you usually lose.

## Summary
- Software is distributed as packages
- Package managers handle dependencies
- Concepts are consistent across distributions
