# ping and traceroute

## Purpose
Test network connectivity and paths.

## Core Concept
`ping` checks reachability using ICMP.
`traceroute` shows the path packets take
to reach a destination.

These tools help identify
where communication fails.

## Engineer Notes
Ping working does not mean the service works.
Ping failing does not always mean the network is down.

Interpret results carefully.

## Summary
- Tests connectivity
- Shows network paths
- Helps isolate network failures
