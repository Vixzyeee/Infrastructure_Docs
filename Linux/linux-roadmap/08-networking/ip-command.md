# ip command

## Purpose
Manage network interfaces and IP configuration.

## Core Concept
The `ip` command replaces older tools like `ifconfig` and `route`.
It manages interfaces, addresses, and routing tables.

Common usage:
- `ip addr`
- `ip link`
- `ip route`

## Engineer Notes
If you still use `ifconfig`, stop.
`ip` is the modern, supported tool.

Most networking visibility starts with `ip addr`.

## Summary
- Modern networking tool
- Manages interfaces and routes
- Replaces legacy commands
