# Linux Roadmap Rules

1. One file represents one concept or command.
2. All documentation must be written in English.
3. Commands must be tested before being documented.
4. Notes must explain behavior, not just syntax.
5. Labs are separated from theory.
6. Small, frequent commits are preferred over large commits.
7. This repository is documentation, not a command cheat sheet.
