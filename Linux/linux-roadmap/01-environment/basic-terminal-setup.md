# Basic Terminal Setup

## Purpose
This section introduces the Linux terminal as the primary interface
for interacting with the system.

## Core Concept
The terminal provides direct access to the shell,
which allows users to run commands, manage files,
and control system behavior.

Most Linux systems use Bash as the default shell.
The shell interprets commands, executes programs,
and supports scripting and automation.

Terminal usage is faster, more precise, and more automatable
than graphical interfaces for system-level work.

## Engineer Notes
Engineers rely heavily on the terminal because it enables
remote access, automation, and repeatability.
Many server environments do not provide graphical interfaces at all.

Becoming comfortable with the terminal early
prevents dependency on GUIs and improves efficiency.

## Summary
- The terminal is the main interface for Linux systems
- Bash is the most common default shell
- Terminal proficiency is essential for infrastructure work
