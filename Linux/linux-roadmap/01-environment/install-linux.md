# Installing Linux

## Purpose
This section explains common ways to install and run Linux
and helps choose the right setup for learning and development.

## Core Concept
Linux can be installed and used in several ways:
- Bare metal installation on physical hardware
- Virtual machines (VMs) using tools like VirtualBox or VMware
- Cloud virtual machines provided by cloud platforms
- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

For learning and infrastructure work, virtual machines and cloud VMs
are commonly used because they are easy to create, reset, and automate.

The choice of Linux distribution affects package management
and default configuration, but core Linux concepts remain the same.

## Engineer Notes
For long-term learning, using a real Linux environment
(either VM or cloud) is strongly preferred over temporary sandboxes.

Using Ubuntu or Debian-based distributions is practical for beginners
because of strong community support and documentation.
Enterprise environments may use RHEL-based systems,
but the fundamentals are transferable.

## Summary
- Linux can run on hardware, VMs, cloud, or WSL
- VMs and cloud instances are ideal for learning
- Distribution choice matters less than understanding fundamentals
