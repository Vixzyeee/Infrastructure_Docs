# at Command

## Purpose
Schedule one-time tasks.

## Core Concept
The `at` command schedules commands
to run once at a specified time.

It is useful for delayed execution
without recurring schedules.

## Engineer Notes
Use `at` for one-off tasks,
not recurring automation.

Jobs queued with at
should be reviewed and cleaned up.

## Summary
- Schedules one-time jobs
- Executes at a specific time
- Not for recurring tasks
