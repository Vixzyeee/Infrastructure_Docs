# Cron Basics

## Purpose
Introduce cron as a scheduling system.

## Core Concept
Cron runs commands at scheduled times.
Schedules are defined using time fields
such as minute, hour, day, month, and weekday.

Cron runs in a minimal environment
with limited variables.

## Engineer Notes
Most cron failures are environment-related.
Always use absolute paths.

Never assume cron behaves like your shell.

## Summary
- Schedules recurring jobs
- Uses time-based syntax
- Runs in a minimal environment
