# Automation Basics

## Purpose
Explain why automation is essential in Linux systems.

## Core Concept
Automation replaces manual repetition
with predictable, repeatable execution.

Automated tasks reduce human error,
save time, and improve reliability.

If a task must be done more than once,
it should probably be automated.

## Engineer Notes
Automation amplifies intent.
Good intent scales well.
Bad intent fails faster.

Automate carefully.

## Summary
- Automation reduces repetition
- Improves consistency and reliability
- Requires careful design
