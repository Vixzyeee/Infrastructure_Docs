# grep

## Purpose
Search for text patterns inside files.

## Core Concept
The `grep` command scans input and prints lines
that match a given pattern.

Common options:
- `-i` ignore case
- `-r` recursive search
- `-n` show line numbers

## Engineer Notes
`grep` is one of the most-used tools in Linux.
Logs, configs, source code — everything gets grepped.

Learn it well. It pays rent.

## Summary
- Searches text patterns
- Works on files and command output
- Essential for log analysis
