# more

## Purpose
View file contents one screen at a time.

## Core Concept
The `more` command displays file contents page by page
but with fewer features than `less`.

## Engineer Notes
`more` exists mostly for historical reasons.
Use `less` unless you’re on a very minimal system.

## Summary
- Simple pager
- Limited compared to `less`
