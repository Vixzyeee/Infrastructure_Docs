# Group Management

## Purpose
Manage groups and group membership.

## Core Concept
Groups allow multiple users
to share access to resources.

Common commands:
- `groupadd`
- `groupmod`
- `groupdel`
- `usermod -aG`

Users can belong to multiple groups.

## Engineer Notes
Groups are the clean way
to grant shared access.

Avoid permission hacks
when groups solve the problem.

## Summary
- Groups control shared access
- Users can belong to many groups
- Cleaner than per-user permissions
