# Users and Groups Basics

## Purpose
Explain how Linux supports multi-user environments.

## Core Concept
Linux is designed as a multi-user system.
Every process runs as a user
and belongs to one or more groups.

Permissions are evaluated based on:
- file owner
- group ownership
- others

Users represent identities.
Groups represent collections of permissions.

## Engineer Notes
If you understand users and groups,
permissions stop being mysterious.

If you don’t, everything looks broken.

## Summary
- Linux is a multi-user system
- Processes run as users
- Groups organize access
