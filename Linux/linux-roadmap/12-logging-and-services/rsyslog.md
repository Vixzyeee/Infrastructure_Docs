# rsyslog

## Purpose
Explain traditional syslog logging.

## Core Concept
rsyslog handles log messages
and writes them to files under `/var/log`.

It can forward logs to remote systems
and apply filtering rules.

Not all systems rely solely on journald.

## Engineer Notes
Many environments still use rsyslog
for compatibility and central logging.

Understanding rsyslog helps
when dealing with legacy systems.

## Summary
- Writes logs to /var/log
- Supports filtering and forwarding
- Still widely used
