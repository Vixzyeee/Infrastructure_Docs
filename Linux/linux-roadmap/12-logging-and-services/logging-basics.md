# Logging Basics

## Purpose
Explain why logs exist and how Linux uses them.

## Core Concept
Logs record events generated by the kernel,
services, and applications.

Logs help answer:
- what happened
- when it happened
- why it failed

Without logs, troubleshooting is guesswork.

## Engineer Notes
If you are not checking logs,
you are not debugging.
You are hoping.

Logs are the first place to look,
not the last.

## Summary
- Logs record system events
- Essential for troubleshooting
- Always check logs first
