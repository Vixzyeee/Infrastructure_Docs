# Linux in CI/CD Systems

## Purpose
Explain Linux’s role in CI/CD pipelines.

## Core Concept
CI/CD runners typically run on Linux.
Builds, tests, and deployments
execute inside Linux environments.

Shell scripts often glue pipelines together.

## Engineer Notes
If your scripts only work on your laptop,
they will fail in CI.

CI environments are minimal and strict.
Design accordingly.

## Summary
- CI/CD commonly runs on Linux
- Pipelines rely on shell and scripts
- Environments are minimal
