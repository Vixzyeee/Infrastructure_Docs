# Linux in Cloud Environments

## Purpose
Explain how Linux is used in cloud infrastructure.

## Core Concept
Most cloud workloads run on Linux.
Virtual machines, managed services,
and container platforms rely on Linux features.

Cloud Linux systems are:
- ephemeral
- automated
- reproducible

Manual configuration does not scale.

## Engineer Notes
If you treat cloud servers like pets,
you will suffer.

Cloud Linux systems should be disposable
and rebuilt automatically.

## Summary
- Linux dominates cloud workloads
- Systems are automated and reproducible
- Manual management does not scale
