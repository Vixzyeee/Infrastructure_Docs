# Observability Basics

## Purpose
Introduce monitoring and observability concepts.

## Core Concept
Observability includes:
- logs
- metrics
- traces

Linux provides raw data
that observability tools collect and analyze.

Visibility is required
to operate systems reliably.

## Engineer Notes
If you can’t see it,
you can’t fix it.

Observability should be built in,
not added after failures.

## Summary
- Observability includes logs, metrics, traces
- Linux provides core system data
- Visibility enables reliability
