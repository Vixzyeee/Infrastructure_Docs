# Operational Best Practices

## Purpose
Summarize best practices for operating Linux systems.

## Core Concept
Operational excellence comes from:
- automation
- documentation
- monitoring
- controlled change

Linux systems should be predictable,
observable, and recoverable.

## Engineer Notes
Most outages are operational failures,
not software bugs.

Good operations are boring.
That is the goal.

## Summary
- Automation and documentation matter
- Monitoring prevents surprises
- Boring systems are healthy systems
