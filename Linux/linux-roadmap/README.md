# Linux Roadmap

This directory contains a structured Linux learning roadmap,
from fundamentals to advanced topics, designed with an engineer-oriented approach.

## Goals
- Understand how Linux works internally
- Build strong command-line proficiency
- Develop a troubleshooting mindset
- Prepare for DevOps, Cloud, and Infrastructure roles

## Scope
This roadmap focuses on:
- Linux system fundamentals
- Filesystem, processes, and permissions
- Networking and services
- Shell and automation basics
- Practical labs and real-world scenarios

## Structure
Each directory represents a learning phase.
Each file documents a single concept or command.
Labs are separated to reinforce hands-on practice.

This roadmap follows the same structured philosophy
as the Python roadmap in this repository.
