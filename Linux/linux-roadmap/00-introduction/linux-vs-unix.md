# Linux vs Unix

## Purpose
This section explains the relationship between Unix and Linux and clarifies
why they are often confused with each other.

## Core Concept
Unix is a family of operating systems originally developed in the 1970s at
AT&T Bell Labs. Over time, Unix evolved into several commercial systems such as
AIX, HP-UX, and Solaris.

Linux is not Unix. It is a Unix-like operating system created independently
by Linus Torvalds. Linux follows many of the same design principles and standards
as Unix, including POSIX compliance, which makes their behavior similar.

The key difference is licensing and development model.
Most Unix systems are proprietary and vendor-controlled, while Linux is
open-source and community-driven.

## Engineer Notes
From a practical engineering perspective, Linux behaves like Unix in most
day-to-day operations. Commands, filesystem layout, permissions, and process
models are largely compatible.

However, Linux offers greater flexibility, customization, and scalability,
which is why it dominates modern infrastructure, cloud platforms,
and containerized environments.

## Summary
- Unix is the original operating system family
- Linux is Unix-like, not Unix itself
- Linux is open-source and widely used in infrastructure
