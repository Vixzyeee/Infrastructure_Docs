# lsblk

## Purpose
List block devices and their structure.

## Core Concept
The `lsblk` command shows disks, partitions,
and mount points in a tree format.

It helps visualize how storage is laid out.

## Engineer Notes
`lsblk` is the first command to run
when diagnosing storage issues.

If it’s not listed in lsblk,
Linux does not see the device.

## Summary
- Lists disks and partitions
- Shows mount points
- Essential for storage inspection
