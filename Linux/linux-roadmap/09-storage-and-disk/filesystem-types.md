# Filesystem Types

## Purpose
Introduce common Linux filesystem types.

## Core Concept
Different filesystems have different features.
Common types include:
- ext4
- xfs
- btrfs

Each filesystem has trade-offs
in performance, reliability, and features.

## Engineer Notes
Ext4 is a safe default.
XFS is common in enterprise environments.
Btrfs offers advanced features but adds complexity.

Choose boring unless you need fancy.

## Summary
- Multiple filesystem types exist
- Each has strengths and weaknesses
- Default choices are usually safest
