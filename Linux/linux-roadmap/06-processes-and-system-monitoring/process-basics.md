# Process Basics

## Purpose
Explain what a process is and how Linux manages running programs.

## Core Concept
A process is an instance of a running program.
Each process has a unique process ID (PID)
and is managed by the Linux kernel.

Processes can create child processes
and exist in different states such as running,
sleeping, stopped, or zombie.

## Engineer Notes
Most performance and stability issues
are related to process behavior.

Understanding process states
helps diagnose system slowdowns and hangs.

## Summary
- A process is a running program
- Each process has a PID
- Processes have different states
