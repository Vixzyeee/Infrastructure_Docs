# System Status and Load

## Purpose
Understand overall system health.

## Core Concept
System status includes:
- CPU load
- memory usage
- uptime
- number of running processes

Commands like `uptime` and `free`
provide quick system summaries.

## Engineer Notes
High load does not always mean high CPU usage.
Understanding load averages prevents misdiagnosis.

Always check system-wide metrics
before blaming individual processes.

## Summary
- Shows system health indicators
- Load averages matter
- Helps diagnose performance issues
