# ps

## Purpose
Display information about running processes.

## Core Concept
The `ps` command provides a snapshot
of current processes.

Common usage:
- `ps aux`
- `ps -ef`

## Engineer Notes
`ps aux` is the fastest way
to find out what is running and who owns it.

Combine `ps` with `grep`
to locate specific processes.

## Summary
- Shows running processes
- Snapshot-based view
- Commonly used with grep
