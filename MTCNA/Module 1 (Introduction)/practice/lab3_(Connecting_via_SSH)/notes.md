## What is SSH?

SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic remote-access protocol used to securely manage network devices and servers.  
It provides encrypted communication, strong authentication mechanisms, and protection against session hijacking or credential interception.  
SSH is the industry standard for administrative access in modern network and server environments.
SSH operates at Layer 3 and requires the device to have an assigned IP address before a connection can be established.

## Understanding Connection Methods

**SSH Login**  
SSH establishes a secure, encrypted session between the client and the device, ensuring that credentials and command traffic cannot be intercepted.  
It supports password-based authentication as well as public key authentication, making it suitable for both manual administration and automated workflows.  
SSH is the recommended access method for any production environment due to its security, reliability, and compatibility with automation tools.
