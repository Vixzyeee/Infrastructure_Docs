## What this covers

Redundancy design balances cost and complexity.<br>
More redundancy is not always better.

## Key concepts

- Single point of failure
- Layered redundancy
- Failure domains

## Why it matters

Bad HA design fails catastrophically.<br>
Good design fails gracefully.

## Common mistakes

- Redundant routers, single ISP
- No documentation

## Real-world example

Router survives failure.<br>
ISP outage still kills network.
