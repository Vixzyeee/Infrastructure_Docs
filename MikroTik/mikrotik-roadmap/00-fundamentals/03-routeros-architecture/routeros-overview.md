## What this covers

RouterOS is a specialized network OS.<br>
It is not Linux, but heavily inspired by it.

## Key concepts

- Single-purpose networking OS
- Configuration stored in database
- Deterministic behavior over flexibility

## Why it matters

RouterOS behavior is predictable.<br>
Understanding architecture prevents false assumptions.

## Common mistakes

- Treating RouterOS like a general Linux distro
- Expecting filesystem-level control

## Real-world example

Admin looks for iptables.<br>
Actual firewall lives in RouterOS packet flow.
