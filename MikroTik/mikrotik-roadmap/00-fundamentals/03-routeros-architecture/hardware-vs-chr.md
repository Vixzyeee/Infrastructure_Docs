## What this covers

RouterOS runs on hardware and virtual platforms.<br>
Behavior is mostly identical.

## Key concepts

- Hardware offload
- Virtual NIC limitations
- Performance tuning differences

## Common mistakes

- Expecting CHR to match ASIC switching
- Ignoring virtualization bottlenecks

## Real-world example

CHR routing fine.<br>
Bridging slow due to no hardware offload.
