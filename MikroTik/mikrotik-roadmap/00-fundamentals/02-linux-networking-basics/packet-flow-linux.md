Packet flow explains the real traffic path.<br>
Not menu order.

## Key concepts

- Ingress interface
- Routing decision
- Firewall hooks
- Egress interface

## Why it matters in MikroTik

RouterOS packet flow is Linux-inspired.<br>
Understanding this prevents blind debugging.

## Common mistakes

- Debugging from Winbox menus
- Ignoring ingress vs egress

## Real-world example

Firewall rule looks correct.<br>
Packet never hits that chain.
