## What this covers

QoS controls traffic rate and priority.<br>
It does not create bandwidth.

## Key concepts

- Shaping vs policing
- Upload vs download control
- Queue placement

## Why it matters in MikroTik

QoS works best at bottleneck.<br>
Wrong placement = no effect.

## Common mistakes

- Applying queues on wrong interface
- Expecting speed increase

## Real-world example

QoS configured correctly.<br>
No visible effect due to wrong bottleneck.
