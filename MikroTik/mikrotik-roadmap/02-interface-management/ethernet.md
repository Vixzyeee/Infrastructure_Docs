## What this covers

Ethernet is a physical interface.<br>
It defines link state, speed, and duplex.

## Key concepts

- Auto-negotiation
- Speed and duplex
- Link up vs operational up

## Why it matters in MikroTik

All higher features depend on Ethernet health.<br>
Bad link equals bad network.

## Common mistakes

- Forcing speed incorrectly
- Ignoring link errors

## Real-world example

Interface shows UP.<br>
Actual throughput unstable due to duplex mismatch.
