## What this covers

Bridge connects interfaces at Layer 2.<br>
It defines broadcast domains.

## Key concepts

- Bridge vs switch
- Hardware offload
- VLAN filtering

## Why it matters in MikroTik

Bridge is the core of switching.<br>
Wrong bridge design kills performance.

## Common mistakes

- Using bridge without VLAN filtering
- Expecting routing behavior from bridge

## Real-world example

High CPU usage.<br>
Bridge runs without hardware offload.
