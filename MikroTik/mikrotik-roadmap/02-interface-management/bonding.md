## What this covers

Bonding aggregates multiple links.<br>
It increases bandwidth or redundancy.

## Key concepts

- Bonding modes
- Hashing behavior
- Link failure handling

## Why it matters in MikroTik

Wrong bonding mode breaks traffic flow.<br>
Both sides must match.

## Common mistakes

- Mismatched bonding modes
- Expecting per-flow speed increase

## Real-world example

One link idle.<br>
Hashing sends all traffic to one slave.
