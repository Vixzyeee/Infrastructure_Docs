## What this covers

SFP and SFP+ are pluggable interfaces.<br>
They depend on module and cable compatibility.

## Key concepts

- Module type (SR, LR, DAC)
- Temperature and signal levels
- Auto-negotiation limits

## Why it matters in MikroTik

Wrong module choice causes flapping links.<br>
Not all SFPs behave the same.

## Common mistakes

- Mixing vendor-incompatible modules
- Ignoring optical power levels

## Real-world example

Link goes up and down.<br>
SFP overheating under load.
