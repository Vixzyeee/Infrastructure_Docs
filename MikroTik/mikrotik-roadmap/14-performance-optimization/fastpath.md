## What this covers

FastPath bypasses parts of packet processing.<br>
Improves throughput.

## Key concepts

- Stateless forwarding
- Feature bypass
- Platform support

## Why it matters in MikroTik

FastPath reduces CPU usage.<br>
Not all features are compatible.

## Common mistakes

- Assuming FastPath is always active
- Forgetting feature interaction

## Real-world example

Throughput low unexpectedly.<br>
Feature disables FastPath silently.
