## What this covers

Throughput testing measures real performance.<br>
Not speedtest placebo.

## Key concepts

- TCP vs UDP testing
- Single vs multi-stream
- CPU monitoring

## Why it matters

Without measurement, optimization is guessing.<br>
Numbers matter.

## Common mistakes

- Testing through Wi-Fi
- Ignoring CPU bottleneck

## Real-world example

Advertised speed not reached.<br>
CPU maxed during test.
