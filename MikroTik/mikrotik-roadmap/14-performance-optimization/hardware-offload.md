## What this covers

Hardware offload moves processing to ASIC.<br>
Massive performance improvement.

## Key concepts

- Switch chip capabilities
- Offload limitations
- Bridge configuration

## Why it matters

CPU freed for routing and firewall.<br>
Critical for high throughput.

## Common mistakes

- Expecting all traffic offloaded
- Mixing incompatible features

## Real-world example

High CPU usage persists.<br>
Traffic not offloaded to hardware.
