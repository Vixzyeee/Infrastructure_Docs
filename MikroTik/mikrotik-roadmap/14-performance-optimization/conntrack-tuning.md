## What this covers

Connection tracking tuning adjusts state behavior.<br>
Balances memory and performance.

## Key concepts

- Timeout values
- Table size
- Protocol behavior

## Why it matters

Default values may not scale.<br>
High connection count needs tuning.

## Common mistakes

- Reducing timeouts blindly
- Disabling conntrack unnecessarily

## Real-world example

Connections drop randomly.<br>
Timeout too aggressive.
