## What this covers

FastTrack accelerates established connections.<br>
Stateful optimization.

## Key concepts

- Connection state
- Firewall interaction
- CPU offload

## Why it matters

Huge performance gain.<br>
But skips queues and mangle.

## Common mistakes

- Using FastTrack with QoS
- Forgetting traffic exclusion

## Real-world example

QoS stops working.<br>
FastTrack enabled globally.
