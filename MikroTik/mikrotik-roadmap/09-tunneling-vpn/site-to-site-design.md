## What this covers

Site-to-site VPN design principles.<br>
Topology matters more than protocol.

## Key concepts

- Hub-and-spoke vs mesh
- Routing over VPN
- Failover considerations

## Why it matters

Bad design scales poorly.<br>
Good design survives failure.

## Common mistakes

- Flat topology
- No routing control

## Real-world example

Adding site breaks network.<br>
No scalable design.
