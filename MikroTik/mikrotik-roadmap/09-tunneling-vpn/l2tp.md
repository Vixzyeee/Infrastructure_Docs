L2TP creates VPN tunnels.<br>
Often paired with IPsec.

## Key concepts

- PPP authentication
- IPsec encryption
- Client compatibility

## Why it matters in MikroTik

Widely supported.<br>
Good balance of security and compatibility.

## Common mistakes

- Using L2TP without IPsec
- Weak authentication

## Real-world example

Tunnel connects.<br>
Traffic intercepted due to no encryption.
