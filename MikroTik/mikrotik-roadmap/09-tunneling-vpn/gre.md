## What this covers

GRE creates simple IP tunnels.<br>
No encryption by default.

## Key concepts

- Encapsulation
- MTU overhead
- Tunnel endpoints

## Why it matters in MikroTik

Fast and flexible.<br>
Often combined with IPsec.

## Common mistakes

- Assuming GRE is secure
- Ignoring MTU issues

## Real-world example

Tunnel up but traffic drops.<br>
MTU not adjusted.
