## What this covers

STP prevents Layer 2 loops.<br>
It is mandatory in multi-switch setups.

## Key concepts

- Root bridge
- Port roles
- STP vs RSTP

## Why it matters in MikroTik

Loop = instant network meltdown.<br>
STP prevents it automatically.

## Common mistakes

- Disabling STP for “performance”
- Ignoring topology changes

## Real-world example

Network down after cable move.<br>
Loop created without STP.
