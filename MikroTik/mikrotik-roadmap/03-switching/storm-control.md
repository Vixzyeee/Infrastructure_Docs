## What this covers

Storm control limits broadcast and multicast floods.<br>
Protects network from loops and misbehaving devices.

## Key concepts

- Broadcast thresholds
- Multicast handling
- Loop protection

## Why it matters in MikroTik

Broadcast storms can kill CPU.<br>
Especially on bridges.

## Common mistakes

- No storm limits at all
- Thresholds set too low

## Real-world example

Network freezes randomly.<br>
Broadcast storm saturates bridge.
