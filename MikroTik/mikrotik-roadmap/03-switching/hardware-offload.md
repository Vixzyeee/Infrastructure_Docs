## What this covers

Hardware offload moves switching to ASIC.<br>
CPU stays free for routing and firewall.

## Key concepts

- Offload-capable ports
- FastPath vs hardware offload
- Switch-chip limitations

## Why it matters in MikroTik

Performance depends on offload.<br>
Software switching does not scale.

## Common mistakes

- Assuming all ports are offloaded
- Breaking offload with wrong config

## Real-world example

High CPU on simple traffic.<br>
Offload disabled by VLAN misconfig.
