## What this covers

DHCP Server distributes IP configuration.<br>
It controls client network behavior.

## Key concepts

- Address pool
- Lease time
- Gateway and DNS options

## Why it matters in MikroTik

Bad DHCP design breaks clients silently.<br>
Issues appear outside the router.

## Common mistakes

- Pool not matching subnet
- Multiple DHCP servers on same LAN

## Real-world example

Clients get IP but no internet.<br>
Wrong gateway option.
