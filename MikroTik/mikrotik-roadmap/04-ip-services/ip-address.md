## What this covers

IP address binds Layer 3 to an interface.<br>
No IP, no routing.

## Key concepts

- Primary vs secondary address
- Interface-based IP model
- Address scope

## Why it matters in MikroTik

Routing and firewall depend on IP placement.<br>
Wrong interface = wrong traffic path.

## Common mistakes

- Assigning IP to wrong interface
- Overlapping subnets

## Real-world example

Client unreachable.<br>
IP assigned to bridge instead of VLAN interface.
