## What this covers

Failover design ensures availability.<br>
Not performance.

## Key concepts

- Active-passive vs active-active
- Detection methods
- Convergence time

## Why it matters in MikroTik

Bad failover causes packet loss.<br>
Users notice immediately.

## Common mistakes

- Overcomplicated logic
- Using scripts for everything

## Real-world example

Failover flaps repeatedly.<br>
Detection target unstable.
