## What this covers

Policy routing selects routes based on rules.<br>
Not just destination.

## Key concepts

- Routing marks
- Mangle rules
- Routing tables

## Why it matters in MikroTik

Multi-WAN depends on policy routing.<br>
Default routing is not enough.

## Common mistakes

- Marking traffic too late
- Forgetting routing table binding

## Real-world example

Specific traffic ignores WAN rule.<br>
Mangle applied after routing.
