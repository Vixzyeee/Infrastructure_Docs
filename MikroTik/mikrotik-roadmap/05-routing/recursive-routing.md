## What this covers

Recursive routing checks gateway reachability.<br>
It enables intelligent failover.

## Key concepts

- Recursive lookup
- Check-gateway behavior
- Target reachability

## Why it matters in MikroTik

Most WAN failover uses recursion.<br>
Not scripts.

## Common mistakes

- Checking wrong target
- Recursive loop creation

## Real-world example

Failover never triggers.<br>
Gateway IP still reachable.
