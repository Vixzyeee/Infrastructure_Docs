## What this covers

Static routing uses manual paths.<br>
Simple, predictable, and dangerous if misused.

## Key concepts

- Destination prefix
- Gateway
- Distance

## Why it matters in MikroTik

Static routes are everywhere.<br>
Even dynamic routing relies on them.

## Common mistakes

- Forgetting gateway reachability
- Using static routes everywhere

## Real-world example

Backup link never used.<br>
Distance not configured.
