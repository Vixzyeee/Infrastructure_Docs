## What this covers

Data center networks prioritize throughput and low latency.<br>
Failure isolation is key.

## Key concepts

- Spine-leaf architecture
- East-west traffic
- Redundant paths

## Why it matters

Small latency adds up.<br>
Design choices are expensive to fix later.

## Common mistakes

- Overusing Layer 2
- No clear traffic separation

## Real-world example

One link failure halves capacity.<br>
No proper ECMP design.
