# Number Calculator

This mini project is part of the **01-basics** section.

It is a simple command-line program that performs basic arithmetic
operations using user input.

---

## Scope

This project intentionally uses only:

- variables
- `input()`
- `print()`
- explicit type conversion (`int`)
- basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`)

---

## Restrictions

This project does **NOT** use:

- `if / else`
- loops (`for`, `while`)
- functions
- lists, tuples, or dictionaries
- external modules or imports
- error handling

These limitations are intentional and match the learning goals of
the **01-basics** stage.

---

## Program Behavior

The program:

1. Asks the user to input two numbers
2. Converts the inputs from string to integer
3. Calculates:
   - addition
   - subtraction
   - multiplication
4. Prints the results in a readable format

If the user inputs a non-numeric value, the program may crash.
This is acceptable at this stage.

---

## Learning Goals

- Understand that `input()` always returns a string
- Practice explicit type conversion
- Observe linear, top-to-bottom program execution
- Build confidence with basic Python syntax

---

## Notes

This project is meant for learning purposes only.
Simplicity is intentional.
