# Profile Generator

This mini project belongs to the **01-basics** section.

It is a simple command-line program that collects basic user information,
performs explicit type conversion, and prints a formatted profile summary.

---

## Scope

This project intentionally uses only:

- variables
- `input()`
- `print()`
- explicit type conversion (`int`, `float`)
- basic arithmetic operations

---

## Restrictions

This project does **NOT** use:

- `if / else`
- loops (`for`, `while`)
- functions
- lists, tuples, or dictionaries
- external modules or imports
- input validation or error handling

All limitations are intentional and match the learning goals of
the **01-basics** stage.

---

## Program Behavior

The program:

1. Displays a title
2. Asks the user to input:
   - name (string)
   - age (integer)
   - height in centimeters (float)
3. Converts the input values to the appropriate data types
4. Calculates the user's age for the next year
5. Prints a formatted profile summary

If the user provides invalid numeric input, the program may crash.
This is acceptable at this stage.

---

## Learning Goals

- Understand that `input()` always returns a string
- Practice explicit type conversion
- Distinguish between integers and floating-point numbers
- Observe linear, top-to-bottom program execution
- Build confidence with basic Python syntax

---

## Notes

This project is designed for learning purposes.
Simplicity is intentional.
