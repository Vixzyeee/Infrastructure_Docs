# Virtual Environment Setup

A virtual environment is used to isolate Python dependencies
for each project and avoid conflicts with system-wide packages.

Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Deactivate the virtual environment:

```bash
deactivate
```
