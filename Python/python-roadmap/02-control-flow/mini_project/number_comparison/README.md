# Number Comparison

This mini project belongs to the **02-control-flow** section.

It is a simple command-line program that reads two numbers and determines their relationship (greater than, less than, or equal).

---

## Scope

This project intentionally uses only:

- `input()`
- `print()`
- `int()`
- `if / elif / else`

---

## Program Behavior

The program:

1. Displays a title
2. Asks the user to input two numbers
3. Converts both inputs to integers
4. Compares the two numbers
5. Prints one of the following results:

- first number is greater  
- second number is greater  
- both numbers are equal  

---

## Logic Rules

The comparison logic follows these rules:

- if the first number is greater than the second, report that the first is greater  
- if the second number is greater than the first, report that the second is greater  
- if both are equal, report equality  

Only one message is printed for each run.

## Input Validation

Input is assumed to be numeric.

If non-numeric input is given, the program may crash due to integer conversion.  
This is acceptable at this learning stage and is not handled intentionally.

## Restrictions

This project does **NOT**
