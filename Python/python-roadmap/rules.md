# Python Roadmap Rules

1. Learning must follow the defined order in this roadmap
2. Every learning folder must contain a README.md
3. Code without explanation is considered incomplete
4. Virtual environments must never be committed to git
5. Core Python fundamentals must be completed before automation or frameworks
6. This roadmap focuses on understanding, not memorization
