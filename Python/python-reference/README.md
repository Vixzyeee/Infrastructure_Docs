# Python Reference

This directory is a structured reference for Python language elements.
It is designed for quick lookup, not as a tutorial.

## Design Principles
- Reference, not step-by-step learning
- Grouped by usage context
- Minimal explanation, clear examples
- Includes expected output when applicable

## Structure Overview

### keywords/
Python language grammar and syntax.
Examples: control flow, function and class definitions, error handling keywords.

### builtins/
Objects that are available without importing anything.
Includes built-in functions, types, constants, and utilities.

### methods/
Object-specific operations.
Examples: list methods, dict methods, string methods.

### exceptions/
Runtime error classes.
Includes built-in exceptions and custom exception patterns.

### operators/
Python operators grouped by category.
Examples: arithmetic, comparison, logical operators.

## How to Use
- Use roadmap to decide what to learn
- Use reference to recall syntax and behavior
- Use labs to practice concepts in real code
