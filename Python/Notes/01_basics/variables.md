# Variables in Python

Variables are containers used to store data in memory. Python creates variables automatically when a value is assigned to a name. Unlike some languages, Python does not require explicit type declarations.

A variable is created when a value is assigned:

```python
x = 10
name = "Alice"
is_active = True
